## What still needs to be done:

### Manual configuration (user action required — no code needed):
- [ ] Add `COMPANY_BACKUP_EMAIL` in Vercel env variables (Gmail backup address)
- [ ] Register Stripe webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard (see instructions below)
- [ ] Add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to Vercel env variables after webhook creation
- [ ] Add `https://redcube-wealthos.vercel.app/auth/reset-password` to Supabase allowed redirect URLs
- [ ] Run migration 006 and 007 in Supabase SQL editor if not already done

### Testing / verification (needs production environment):
- [ ] Test full assessment → summary → email flow end to end on production
- [ ] Verify PDF emails arrive at client and advisor email addresses
- [ ] Verify advisor dropdown shows registered advisors
- [ ] Test password reset flow end to end (requires Supabase redirect URL above)
- [ ] Test Stripe checkout → plan activation → billing portal on production
- [ ] Verify upgrade success banner appears after Stripe checkout

### Remaining features to build:
- [ ] White-label branding for Enterprise plan
- [ ] Compliance audit trail for Enterprise plan
- [ ] SSO / Active Directory for Enterprise plan

## Roadmap — Not yet built (in priority order)

### High Priority
- [ ] Subscription enforcement — paywall when trial expires
  - PaywallOverlay component in dashboard layout
  - Check subscription_status and trial_ends_at on every dashboard visit
  - Block access if expired, show upgrade prompt
  - Trial ending email reminder (customer.subscription.trial_will_end webhook)
  - Add customer.subscription.trial_will_end to Stripe webhook events

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Custom domain setup — redcubefinancial.com instead of vercel.app
- [ ] White-label branding for Enterprise plan
- [ ] Admin panel — manage all advisors and clients
- [ ] Analytics dashboard — track submissions, conversions, revenue

### Low Priority
- [ ] Client portal — let clients log in and see their own results history
- [ ] CRM integrations — Salesforce, Redtail
- [ ] Document upload and AI analysis
- [ ] Multi-language support

## Auth root cause and fix:
- Problem: @supabase/ssr@0.3.0 had cookie encoding mismatch between browser and server client on Vercel
- Fix: upgraded to @supabase/ssr@0.10.2
- Pattern: browser client signin + router.refresh() + router.push()
- Middleware uses official Supabase SSR pattern with broad matcher

---

## Stripe webhook setup (required for plan activation):
Go to stripe.com → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint
Endpoint URL: `https://redcube-wealthos.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook`
Events to listen for:
- `checkout.session.completed`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

After adding, copy Signing Secret → add to Vercel as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
